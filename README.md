# AES128_EncryptorDecryptor
A Simple Python Implementation of AES Encryption and Decryption

Enter the data needed to be encrypted into "plaintext.txt" file.
The Encryption Process will Encrypt the data and store the Cipher in Hexadecimal format in "encryptedtext.txt"
The Decryption Prcoess will Decrypt the data and store the result in ASCII format in "decrypted.txt"
This is currently only a Test of Concept, but a more detailed code and explanation will be provided on request.
